## ‚ú® Core Philosophy & Design ‚ú®

LearnMint is built on the principles of efficiency, engagement, and elegance, a testament to **MrGarvit's** design philosophy.

*   **Sleek & Modern UI**: A beautiful dark theme (with a light mode toggle!) ensures comfortable study sessions, day or night. Powered by `next-themes`.
*   **Vibrant Color Scheme**: Crafted with HSL CSS variables (`src/app/globals.css`), featuring a sophisticated dark teal primary and an electric lime accent that pops!
*   **Typography Excellence**: Utilizes `GeistSans` for crisp readability and `GeistMono` for that clean, technical look where needed.
*   **Iconography**: `lucide-react` icons provide a consistent and modern visual language throughout the app.
*   **Built with the Best**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, perfectly harmonized with ShadCN UI components for a polished, professional feel.
*   **Responsive & Accessible**: Designed to look and work great on all devices, from mobile to desktop, with accessibility in mind.

Embark on your AI-enhanced learning adventure, crafted by **MrGarvit**!

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   `npm` or `yarn`
*   A Firebase Project (create one at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/)).
    *   Go to **Authentication** (under Build in the Firebase console) -> **Sign-in method** tab.

### 2. CRITICAL: Set up Environment Variables using a `.env` file

<details>
<summary><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Click here for DETAILED `.env` Configuration Guide ‚ö†Ô∏è</strong></summary>

Create a file named `.env` in the **root of your project**. Populate it with your actual Firebase project configuration and API keys. **This step is absolutely essential for the app to function.**

**MrGarvit has provided the following Gemini API keys for enhanced functionality. Distribute them as suggested or per your preference across the available slots in your `.env` file. The key `AIzaSyAYMVP1amZ6fow3WMJ2XspN_8CfkJXpohc` is CRITICAL for image generation.**

```env
# === Firebase Project Configuration (Get these from your Firebase project settings) ===
# Go to Project Settings > General tab > Your apps > Web app SDK snippet
# IMPORTANT: Replace placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials.
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyYOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY_FROM_MRGARVIT_OR_YOURS
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:your-sender-id:web:your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID # Optional for Firebase Analytics

# === Genkit AI Features (Notes, Quizzes, Flashcards, Chatbot AI, Image Generation) ===
# Get your keys from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# Ensure the associated Google Cloud project has the "Generative Language API" (or Vertex AI for newer models) enabled and billing configured.

# Main/Default Gemini API Key (Used for general AI tasks if specific ones below are not set)
# Suggestion from MrGarvit: AIzaSyC9acF8uyEJssqF9ZaMOMvJNLag8EffJlo
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyC9acF8uyEJssqF9ZaMOMvJNLag8EffJlo

# Optional: Separate API Key for Study Notes (Text Generation part) & Derived Content (Quiz/Flashcards from Notes)
# If blank, these features will use GOOGLE_API_KEY.
# Suggestion from MrGarvit: AIzaSyDEbQvjLG_Lb_OtDK-ka3CdcrU19dl72OY
GOOGLE_API_KEY_NOTES=AIzaSyDEbQvjLG_Lb_OtDK-ka3CdcrU19dl72OY

# Optional: Separate API Key for AI Chatbot (Kazuma)
# If blank, the chatbot will use GOOGLE_API_KEY.
# Suggestion from MrGarvit: AIzaSyC3ZI8F99RYeMxkE5OYewSsE0o5GLHvMRs
GOOGLE_API_KEY_CHATBOT=AIzaSyC3ZI8F99RYeMxkE5OYewSsE0o5GLHvMRs

# CRITICAL: API Key for Image Generation within Notes (Gemini 2.0 Flash or equivalent)
# If blank, image generation will attempt to use GOOGLE_API_KEY_NOTES, then GOOGLE_API_KEY.
# Highly Recommended: Use the dedicated key provided by MrGarvit.
# Suggestion from MrGarvit: AIzaSyAYMVP1amZ6fow3WMJ2XspN_8CfkJXpohc
GOOGLE_API_KEY_IMAGES=AIzaSyAYMVP1amZ6fow3WMJ2XspN_8CfkJXpohc

# === Other Service API Keys ===

# For Daily News Digest Feature
# Get your free key from Newsdata.io: https://newsdata.io
NEWSDATA_API_KEY=pub_YOUR_NEWSDATA_API_KEY

# For YouTube Search Integration (Genkit flow, used in Library)
# Get your key from Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=AIzaSyYOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY

# For Google Books Search Integration (Genkit flow, used in Library)
# Get your key from Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/books.googleapis.com
GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=AIzaSyYOUR_GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY
```

**Important Notes for `.env`:**

*   üõë **Valid API Keys are Mandatory!** The example Firebase keys (`AIzaSyYOUR_...`) will not work. Use the ones provided by **MrGarvit** for Firebase or your own. Use the Gemini keys **MrGarvit** provided for the Gemini features.
*   ‚úÖ Ensure **no extra spaces or quotes** around variable names or values.
*   üîë `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` are **essential** for Firebase Authentication.
*   üîç The `console.log` statements in `src/lib/firebase/config.ts` will show you in the **server terminal** if key Firebase variables are `undefined`. This is your primary clue if your `.env` file isn't being read correctly.
*   üñºÔ∏è **CRITICAL for Image Generation:** The key assigned to `GOOGLE_API_KEY_IMAGES` (now suggested as `AIzaSyAYMVP1amZ6fow3WMJ2XspN_8CfkJXpohc`) **MUST** have the "Generative Language API" (or Vertex AI for newer models, specifically the "Gemini API") enabled in its associated Google Cloud Project, **billing MUST be enabled** for that project, and the key must have permissions to use image-capable models like `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`.

</details>

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 4. CRITICAL: Restart Your Development Server

After creating or modifying your `.env` file, **YOU MUST STOP AND RESTART** your Next.js development server:

```bash
# Stop your server (usually Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Then restart it:
npm run dev -- --port 9002
# or
yarn dev --port 9002
```

### 5. CRITICAL: Add Required Static Assets

*   **PWA Icons**: Create `public/icons` and add `icon-192x192.png` & `icon-512x512.png`. (Standard PWA icons)
*   **Sound Effects**: Create `public/sounds` and add `ting.mp3`, `custom-sound-2.mp3`, `correct-answer.mp3`, `incorrect-answer.mp3`.
*   **Chatbot Avatar**: Create `public/images` and add `kazuma-dp.jpg` (for Kazuma chatbot).

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 9002
# or
yarn dev --port 9002
```

Access LearnMint at `http://localhost:9002`.

### 7. Run Genkit Dev Server (Optional but Recommended)

For debugging AI flows (notes, quizzes, chatbot, image generation):

```bash
npm run genkit:dev
# or
npm run genkit:watch
```

Access Genkit UI at `http://localhost:4000`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment to Firebase Hosting ‚òÅÔ∏è

LearnMint, as engineered by **MrGarvit**, is configured for Firebase Hosting using `frameworksBackend` for Next.js.

**Prerequisites:**
*   `firebase-tools` installed: `npm install -g firebase-tools`.
*   Logged into Firebase: `firebase login`.
*   `.firebaserc` correctly specifies your Firebase project ID.

**Deployment Steps:**

1.  ‚úÖ **CRITICAL: Local `.env` for Build:** Ensure your local `.env` has **valid production** API keys for the build process.
2.  üñºÔ∏è **CRITICAL: Add Static Assets:** As per step 5 in "Getting Started".
3.  ‚öôÔ∏è **Build for Production:** `npm run build`
4.  üöÄ **Deploy:** `firebase deploy`
5.  üîë **CRITICAL: Set Environment Variables in Google Cloud for Deployed App (App Hosting):**
    Firebase App Hosting **does not automatically use your local `.env` for the deployed backend functions.** You MUST set them in the Google Cloud Console:
    *   Go to `https://console.cloud.google.com/run?project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID`.
    *   Find your App Hosting service (usually named `learnmint-app` or similar based on `apphosting.yaml`).
    *   Edit configuration -> "Variables & Secrets".
    *   Add **ALL** required production environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY_NOTES`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY_CHATBOT`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY_IMAGES`, `NEWSDATA_API_KEY`, `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY`, etc.).
    *   Deploy the new revision with these variables. **This is crucial for deployed features to work.**

> **Note by MrGarvit:** Ensuring environment variables are set both locally for build and remotely for deployed functions is paramount for a successful deployment!

## üé® Customization üé®

*   **Styling**: Modify `src/app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **AI Prompts**: Tweak prompts in `src/ai/flows/` to alter AI-generated content.
*   **Sound Effects**: Replace files in `public/sounds/`.
