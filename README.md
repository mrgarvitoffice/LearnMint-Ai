## 🚀 Getting Started with LearnMint

Embark on your AI-enhanced learning adventure!

### 1. Prerequisites
*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   A Firebase Project (create one at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/)).
    *   Go to **Authentication** (under Build in the Firebase console) -> **Sign-in method** tab.
    *   Enable **Email/Password**, **Google**, and **Anonymous** sign-in providers. For Google, ensure your project support email is configured.

### 2. CRITICAL: Set up Environment Variables using a `.env` file

Create a file named `.env` in the **root of your project**. Populate it with your actual Firebase project configuration and API keys. **This step is absolutely essential for the app to function.**

```env
# Firebase Project Configuration (Get these from your Firebase project settings)
# Go to Project Settings > General tab > Your apps > Web app SDK snippet
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyYOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com # CRITICAL for Firebase Auth
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:your-sender-id:web:your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID # Optional for Firebase Analytics

# For Genkit AI Features (Notes, Quizzes, Flashcards, Chatbot AI)
# Get your key from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# Ensure the associated Google Cloud project has the "Generative Language API" enabled and billing configured.
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyYOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY

# OPTIONAL: Separate API Key for Study Notes Generation
# If blank, notes generation will use the main GOOGLE_API_KEY above.
GOOGLE_API_KEY_NOTES=
# OPTIONAL: Separate API Key for AI Chatbot (Kazuma)
# If blank, the chatbot will use the main GOOGLE_API_KEY above.
GOOGLE_API_KEY_CHATBOT=

# For Daily News Digest Feature
# Get your free key from Newsdata.io: https://newsdata.io
NEWSDATA_API_KEY=pub_YOUR_NEWSDATA_API_KEY

# For YouTube Search Integration (Genkit flow)
# Get your key from Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=AIzaSyYOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY

# For Google Books Search Integration (Genkit flow)
# Get your key from Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/books.googleapis.com
GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=AIzaSyYOUR_GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY
```

*   **Valid API Keys are Mandatory!** The example keys above will not work.
*   Ensure **no extra spaces or quotes** around variable names or values.
*   **CRITICAL:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` are **essential** for Firebase Authentication.
*   The `console.log` statements in `src/lib/firebase/config.ts` will show you in the **server terminal** if `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, or `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` are `undefined`. This is your primary clue if your `.env` file isn't being read correctly.

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 4. CRITICAL: Restart Your Development Server
After creating or modifying your `.env` file, **YOU MUST STOP AND RESTART** your Next.js development server:
```bash
# Stop your server (usually Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Then restart it:
npm run dev -- --port 9002
# or
yarn dev --port 9002
```

### 5. CRITICAL: Add Required Static Assets
*   **PWA Icons**: Create `public/icons` and add `icon-192x192.png` & `icon-512x512.png`.
*   **Sound Effects**: Create `public/sounds` and add `ting.mp3`, `custom-sound-2.mp3`, `correct-answer.mp3`, `incorrect-answer.mp3`.
*   **Chatbot Avatar**: Create `public/images` and add `kazuma-dp.jpg`.

### 6. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 9002
# or
yarn dev --port 9002
```
Access at `http://localhost:9002`.

### 7. Run Genkit Dev Server (Optional but Recommended)
For debugging AI flows (notes, quizzes, chatbot):
```bash
npm run genkit:dev
# or
npm run genkit:watch
```
Access Genkit UI at `http://localhost:4000`.

## 🚀 Deployment to Firebase Hosting

LearnMint is configured for Firebase Hosting using `frameworksBackend` for Next.js.

**Prerequisites:**
*   `firebase-tools` installed: `npm install -g firebase-tools`.
*   Logged into Firebase: `firebase login`.
*   `.firebaserc` correctly specifies your Firebase project ID.

**Deployment Steps:**

1.  **CRITICAL: Local `.env` for Build:** Ensure your local `.env` has **valid production** API keys.
2.  **CRITICAL: Add Static Assets:** As per step 5 in "Getting Started".
3.  **Build for Production:** `npm run build`
4.  **Deploy:** `firebase deploy`
5.  **CRITICAL: Set Environment Variables in Google Cloud for Deployed App (App Hosting):**
    Firebase App Hosting **does not automatically use your local `.env` for the deployed backend functions.** You MUST set them in the Google Cloud Console:
    *   Go to `https://console.cloud.google.com/run?project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID`.
    *   Find your App Hosting service.
    *   Edit configuration -> "Variables & Secrets".
    *   Add **ALL** required production environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `NEWSDATA_API_KEY`, etc.).
    *   Deploy the new revision with these variables. **This is crucial for deployed features to work.**

## 🎨 Customization

*   **Styling**: Modify `src/app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **AI Prompts**: Tweak prompts in `src/ai/flows/` to alter AI-generated content.
*   **Sound Effects**: Replace files in `public/sounds/`.

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Ideas to Explore!)

*   **Advanced PWA Features**: Offline caching for assets and core content.
*   **Full Library Integration**: Deeper integration of YouTube and Google Books within the app.
*   **Multilingual Support**: UI internationalization and localized AI content.
*   **More Educational Games**: Bring "Chess" and "Dino Runner" to life in the LearnMint Arcade.
*   **User Progress Tracking**: Implement a backend database (e.g., Firebase Firestore) for user profiles, test scores, and progress visualization.
*   **Enhanced Test Features**: Detailed result breakdowns and answer explanations.
*   **Direct AI Image Generation**: Replace `[VISUAL_PROMPT]` placeholders in notes with actual AI-generated images.
